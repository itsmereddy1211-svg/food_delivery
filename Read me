Food Delivery Data Integration and Analysis Project
This project demonstrates a complete data integration workflow using multiple real-world data formats. The dataset consists of three separate sources: transactional order data stored in CSV format, user master data in JSON format, and restaurant master data in SQL format. The main objective of this project is to combine these datasets into a single, structured dataset that can be used for analysis and reporting.
The process begins by loading each file type using Python and appropriate libraries. After loading the data, left join operations are performed using common keys such as user ID and restaurant ID. This ensures that all order records are retained while enriching them with corresponding user and restaurant information. Once the merge process is completed, the final dataset is exported as a CSV file for easy access and further processing.
The consolidated dataset enables multiple analytical use cases, including studying order trends over time, understanding customer behavior patterns, evaluating restaurant performance across different cities and cuisines, analyzing membership impacts such as regular versus premium users, and examining revenue distribution and seasonal patterns.
This project highlights important data engineering concepts such as handling multiple file formats, performing joins, managing missing values, and preparing raw data for analytics. It is ideal for students and beginners who want hands-on experience with real-world data integration, preprocessing workflows, and analytical project development using Python.
